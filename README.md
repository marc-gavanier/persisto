# Persisto

<h2 id="about">🪧 About</h2>

**Persisto** is a simple React Native demo app that showcases state persistence using **AsyncStorage**. Its purpose is to demonstrate how to save, load, and clear data in a mobile app while maintaining a clean and reusable developer experience.

Designed as a lightweight and educational project, Persisto provides a **clear separation between UI components, state management, and persistence logic**, making it easy to reuse and extend in other React Native projects.
